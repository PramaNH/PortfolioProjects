## Introduction

This project analyzes COVID-19 trends and patterns using SQL for data exploration and Tableau for visualization. You can view the interactive dashboard here: [Tableau Public Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/prama.lim/viz/CovidDashboard_17339455160900/Dashboard1).

## Dataset Description

The dataset, sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), includes:
- COVID-19 cases and deaths globally.
- Metrics like testing rates, vaccination progress, and excess mortality.
- Data segmented by countries and regions.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Exploration (SQL)**:
   - Analyze trends such as case fatality rates and testing efficacy.
   - Identify anomalies and outliers in the dataset.
   - Prepare the data for visualization by cleaning and transforming it.

2. **Data Visualization (Tableau)**:
   - Present key trends through interactive dashboards.
   - Use visual elements like maps, bar charts, and line graphs.

## Tools and Technologies

- SSMS: For querying and preparing the dataset.
- Tableau: For building interactive visualizations.

## SQL Data Exploration

Key objectives in SQL analysis:
- Calculate total and daily metrics (e.g., deaths, cases).
- Compare metrics across countries and regions.
- Extract insights about testing rates and vaccine rollouts.
